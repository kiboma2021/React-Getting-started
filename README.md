### WRITING REACT DIRECTLY IN HTML
    -vWe load 3 scripts React, ReactDOM and Babel
    - We then create an empty div element with id of root

    - We the create an script element to add React code

    - Instead of loading the scripts on the head of HTML, we can set up React environment by installing 'create-react-app' CLI tool
